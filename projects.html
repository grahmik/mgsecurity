            <h2>HomeLab</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                <p>I operate a sophisticated HomeLab infrastructure centered around an HP ProLiant DL360 G7 server. Within this robust environment, I host a diverse array of servers and services, each serving a unique purpose and contributing to my ever-evolving expertise in IT and cybersecurity.</p>
                <p>At the core of this setup is my web server, a dynamic platform that showcases my skills in web development, server configuration, and continuous optimization. It serves as a demonstration of my ability to deliver web content securely and efficiently.</p>
                <p>In addition to the web server, my HomeLab houses a Plex server, enriching my proficiency in media server management. This platform not only provides a seamless streaming experience but also enhances my knowledge of content delivery and user experience optimization.</p>
                <p>I've dedicated a portion of my HomeLab to a test enterprise environment, where I can experiment with various enterprise technologies and configurations. This sandbox environment enables me to gain hands-on experience with enterprise-level solutions, expand my knowledge of system architecture, and strengthen my problem-solving capabilities.</p>
                <p>To fortify the security of my HomeLab, I've implemented robust safeguards, including pfSense and Security Onion. These security measures are instrumental in safeguarding my infrastructure against potential threats. They have provided me with valuable insights into intrusion detection, network monitoring, and vulnerability mitigation, enriching my cybersecurity skill set.</p>
                <p>An advanced feature of my HomeLab is the segmentation of the web and Plex servers from the primary network through Virtual LANs (VLANs). This segmentation ensures enhanced security and isolation, preventing any inadvertent security breaches. It has sharpened my skills in network management, VLAN configuration, and network security.</p>
                <p>My HomeLab is not only a versatile playground for various server deployments but also a dynamic environment for continuous learning and skill enhancement. This project is a testament to my dedication to honing my abilities in IT, network security, server administration, and more. It showcases my commitment to staying at the forefront of technology and embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>

            <h2>Hack The Box / In-Person CTFs</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                I participated in the Hack The Box competition at H & R Block HQ in September 2023 where my team came in 6th place. I regularly participate in hands-on cybersecurity challenges on Hack The Box, enhancing practical skills in real-world scenarios. Engaging in a variety of tasks, from network analysis to cryptographic puzzles, demonstrates my dedication to continuous learning, which is essential in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

            <h2>enumBASE</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
                I developed enumBASE, a Linux Post-Exploitation Enumeration Script in Bash, to automate post-exploitation enumeration of Linux systems for penetration testing purposes. The script systematically gathers essential data, aiding in the identification of vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. You can find the script on my GitHub at <a href="https://www.github.com/grahmik/enumbase">https://www.github.com/grahmik/enumbase</a>. This project has significantly improved my scripting and penetration testing skills, allowing me to be more effective in assessing and securing Linux systems.
